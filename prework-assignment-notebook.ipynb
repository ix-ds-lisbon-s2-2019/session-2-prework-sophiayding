    "#In science, data is often shared as well as research outputs such as datasets, statistical codes, lab notes, and figures can be modified. Thus version control, which tracks the changes made in a document or some form of documentation output, is very important in that one would want to be able to see all changes made in case of errors made along the way, or for example, if one was given feedback from peers or collaborators. In the case of the data, users would want to see who did what or who thought of the new point that could be used to make a statement, for clarity and to keep versions safe in the case that a document or data gets mismanaged or deleted in some way.

The last thing is that one was never solving the right problem; the data was well and the model may be effective but it doesn’t deliver the results applicable to the situation at hand. "
